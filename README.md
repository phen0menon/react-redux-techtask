# react-redux-techtask 

Learning Redux for a couple of days, I created this application just for experience.<br>
Production version: https://phen0menon.github.io/react-redux-techtask/

## Using
### `npm start` or `yarn start` 

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. <br>
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test` 

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
